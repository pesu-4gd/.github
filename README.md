## Mission & Vision

- **Mission**: Briefly summarize *what* the Engineering & Ops org exists to deliver.  
- **Vision**: Where do you want to take the org in the future?  
- **Core Principles / Values** (if not covered elsewhere): e.g. “shared ownership, continuous improvement, reliability first.”

---

## High-Level Overview

This document is intended for all Engineering, Operations, Product, QA, and related teams. It describes how we do things *across* the organization: processes, standards, tooling, how teams coordinate, how decisions are made, and so on.

Detailed, team-specific documentation should link back to this central handbook.

---

## Organization Structure

- Org chart (link to image / document)  
- Departments / teams (brief description, domain, dependencies)  
- Reporting lines, cross-team interfaces  
- Key shared services (e.g. Platform / Infra / Security / Data / QA)

---

## Governance & Decision Making

- Decision authority: what decisions different roles / levels can make  
- Proposal / RFC / design-doc process  
- Conflict resolution / escalation paths  
- Approvals & review workflows (e.g. architecture reviews, security reviews)

---

## Standards & Conventions

- Coding & style guides (languages, linting, formatting)  
- Repository structure / naming conventions  
- Branching, versioning, Git workflows (feature branches, CI, trunk / main, release branches)  
- API / interface versioning policies  
- Logging, instrumentation, naming of environments, deployment tags  
- Dependency / package management policies  
- Backward compatibility, deprecation policy

---

## Tech Stack & Tools

- Primary languages / frameworks / platforms  
- Internal libraries / frameworks & guidelines  
- Infrastructure tools: cloud provider, IaC tools, containers, serverless, etc.  
- Dev toolchain: IDEs, local dev environments, debugging, mocks / stubs  
- CI/CD pipeline, build system, test runners  
- Monitoring / logging / metrics / alerting  
- Secrets management, vaulting, key rotation  
- Environments: development, staging, production – how they differ

---

## Onboarding & Getting Started

1. Account & access provisioning checklist  
2. Environment setup: local dev, dependencies, secrets configuration  
3. “Hello World” or sample service / repo to try  
4. Key links (internal docs, style guides, team READMEs, architecture repo)  
5. First-30 / 60 / 90 day expectations & roadmap for a new joiner

---

## Processes & Workflows

- Feature development lifecycle: from idea → ticket → implementation → review → merge → deploy  
- Release / deployment pipeline & steps  
- Hotfix / rollback procedures  
- Testing strategy: unit / integration / end-to-end / performance  
- Incident management / postmortem process  
- Change management, approvals, canary / blue-green deployments  
- Service ownership, on-call rotations, SLA / SLO definitions  
- Architectural review / refactoring cycles

---

## Documentation & Knowledge Base

- Where documentation lives (wiki, docs portal, internal repo)  
- Documentation style & standards  
- Structure / taxonomy / metadata / tagging  
- Ownership & review cycles for docs (who owns which sections)  
- Procedure to propose, update, retire documents  
- How to find existing info (index, search, FAQ)

> **Next Steps:**  
> - Copy this file into your org’s central repo (e.g. `.github/README.md` or an internal “handbook” repo).  
> - Insert real content, links, diagrams, org charts, etc.  
> - Assign an owner or rotating maintainers to keep it fresh.  
> - Encourage all teams to reference it and link back to it.  

If you like, I can generate a version tailored to your tech stack (e.g. Node.js / Python / AWS / Kubernetes) or embed skeleton links to your existing team repos. Would you like me to prepare that?
